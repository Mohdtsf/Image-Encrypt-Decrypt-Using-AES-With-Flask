            The <strong>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</strong> is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely recognized for its
            security and efficiency. Adopted as a standard by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001,
            AES has become the de facto encryption algorithm for a broad range of applications, including securing sensitive data
            in communications, storage, and various information systems.
            <br /><br />
            AES operates on fixed-size blocks of data and supports key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits, providing a balance
            between robust security and computational efficiency. Its strength lies in its resistance to various cryptographic
            attacks, making it a cornerstone for secure communication and data protection in modern computing environments.

            AES is considered one of the best encryption algorithms for several reasons:
            <br /><br />
            <strong>1) Security Strength:</strong>
            AES has withstood extensive cryptanalysis and scrutiny from the global cryptographic community. No practical
            vulnerabilities have been discovered.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>2) Standardization &amp; Adoption:</strong>
            Standardized by NIST and adopted by governments, organizations, and industries worldwide as the de facto
            standard for symmetric key encryption.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>3) Versatility:</strong>
            Supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits, allowing users to choose the level of security based on their
            specific needs.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>4) Efficiency &amp; Performance:</strong>
            Designed for efficiency and is computationally fast. It performs well in everything from resource-constrained
            devices to high-performance computing systems.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>5) Resistance to Attacks:</strong>
            Demonstrated resistance to various cryptographic attacks, including differential and linear cryptanalysis.

            Encryption in AES involves a series of well-defined steps that transform plaintext into ciphertext using a
            symmetric key:
            <br /><br />
            <strong>1. Key Expansion:</strong>
            The original key is expanded into a key schedule using bitwise operations, substitution, and permutation.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>2. Initial Round Key Addition:</strong>
            The 128-bit plaintext block is XORed with the first round key derived from the key expansion.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>3. Rounds (10, 12, or 14):</strong>
            Each round consists of four operations:
            <br />
            &bull; <strong>SubBytes</strong> — Each byte is replaced using the S-box substitution table.
            <br />
            &bull; <strong>ShiftRows</strong> — Bytes in each row are cyclically shifted left.
            <br />
            &bull; <strong>MixColumns</strong> — Columns are mixed via matrix multiplication.
            <br />
            &bull; <strong>Round Key Addition</strong> — The round key is XORed with the state matrix.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>4. Final Round:</strong>
            Similar to other rounds but omits the MixColumns step: SubBytes → ShiftRows → Round Key Addition.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>5. Output:</strong>
            The state matrix is XORed with the last round key, producing the encrypted ciphertext.
